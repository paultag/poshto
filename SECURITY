Hello, there.

This software is not production quality. Because email has such a potental for
misuse, please be advised of the following issues:

 1. So, as of right now (yes, right now!), this app is outstandingly insecure.
    Until better GPG encryption support is built it, passwords *are* stored in
    plain-text on the drive. This is unacceptable.

 2. As well, and on a more fundemental way, the interface is displayed via a web
    server sitting on localhost. As such, any system with more then one user is
    not the platform to run this on. Other users could connect to the running
    session with full rights into your mail. Long-term goal here is to do some
    magic with UNIX Named FIFO sockets, or token-based auth of some sort.

 3. The cache contains full messages & headers unencrypted on the disk. If your
    home directory is viewable by others, they may read or copy your mail.
    Please take steps to ensure your data is secure.

 As these problems get fixed, I'll update them here.
