Howdy!

This document is how to hack on poŝto. Firstly, the word "poŝto" is Esperanto.

Wiktionary defines the word as follows:

     1. a public institution (usually government-run) to
        deliver mail, post
     2. mail distribution in general
     3. one's mail, collectively

We're using the 2ed or 3ed definition. Mostly the third.
